            At SnapPwd, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, 
            use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our service.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect minimal information to provide and improve our service:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous usage statistics such as access times, 
              device information, and IP addresses for security and service improvement purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Encrypted Content:</strong> The content you share through our service is encrypted 
              in your browser before it reaches our servers. We never have access to the unencrypted content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use the information we collect to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues and security threats</li>
            <li>Monitor the usage of our service</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We automatically delete all encrypted content once it has been accessed by the recipient 
            or when it reaches its expiration time, whichever comes first. We do not maintain backups 
            of expired or accessed content.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>
          <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. 
            However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, 
            so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by 
            posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the &quot;Last updated&quot; date.
